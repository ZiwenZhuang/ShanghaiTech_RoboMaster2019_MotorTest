# ShanghaiTech_RoboMaster2019_MotorTest

This project is used for only the basic mechinical test using old robomaster STM board.  
You don't need to mess with the RTOS. And I have changed the code mechanism into Arduino like file (in src folder). You need only to fill in those two functions in UserTest.h file and the program will work.
Be sure to read the annotations in the file.
